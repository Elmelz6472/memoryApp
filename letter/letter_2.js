Anyways it made me realise that I just misread the situation entirely and was looking way too much into it. Ok but for real don’t blame me!

Like Ouadi keeps annoying me because he just wants to eat. Rafik wants me to help him sell. Saifs fucking gay (no offense to anyone you might know is gay as I said I’m freestyling these) and Ali just wants Zaza ughhh.

But yeah, I do need to get myself some hobbies or something parceque c’est grave hahaha.

In other news I got the gifts of Ryame and Mom and they loveee it so that’s nice. Although the drawback is I keep thinking about you with a necklace ughhhh. I guess someone’s going to get a new piece of jewelry (p.s it would be awkward if you were to read this letter before receiving your gift tho) But for real it’s not my fault that every time I try to get you something, I get cock blocked by either Poste Canada, Customs, or the vendors themselves.

But I really hope I’ll get by the 9th at least. If not, please don’t think I’m ignoring you.


I semi successfully manage to make you disclose how you would want a great day to be spent (I kind of put the whole bday thing to work) so hopefully by the time I you read this I would have done so.

Alright well I guess this is it for me today. As you can say I get way less things to say now since we kind of talked about everything today.

Love you!
