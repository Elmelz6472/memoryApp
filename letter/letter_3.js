I’m SOOO fucking bored I swear to God. Like I’m really stuck out there with the bed. It’s funny cause 10-year-old would have considered this heaven on earth. But hey at least I didn’t go to the foot, so you’re not mad at me.

Ngl, I have 0 idea what I’m doing I think I’ll just write whenever I feel like it. So, hey this might be the only entry or the first of many.

Anyways you’ll soon go to Tunisia so at least you’ll have better signal.

Ngl your dress was pretty. Too pretty, like please don’t come back with a ring because then you’ll be a real ranran.

I might have gotten some ideas for a gift for you since tbh we didn’t really celebrate your birthday. Like you got Strangeloves, but it was more because you’re a femme croquante then because it was your bday. I just hope I receive it before you come back the 8th.

But Jesus I’m so bored, once I get better on my feet, I think I’ll take care of the entrepot by myself so that I could distract myself.

Btw you said you have your cramps, and it hurts so I’m sending positive energy. Don’t worry you’ll be fine.  Like when have you ever felt period cramps when the melz is here?

Anyway, see you later alligator.
