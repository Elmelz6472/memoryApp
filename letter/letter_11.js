    I know I haven’t really been keeping track of the journals (or the memoirs?) I mean I don’t even know if you’ll ever read them. To be honest I don’t either, I basically freestyle them and seal them close for ever… Just like my thoughts hahaha…

But seriously I don’t really know why I do/did these. At first, it was some sort of therapy work, and to keep a log of what I did while you were in Algeria. But now… I don’t really think I need to write them, ooo and btw you’ve really opened since our last talk so purr.

It feels so great seeing you with yourself and happy to talk about nothing and everything. Kind of great coincidence since our sixth month is in 2 days and I really think you’ll love the place .

Or we can always just go Jack le Coq.
