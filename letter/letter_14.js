    Ok I think I figured it out, basically I’m thinking of something long term that you could for years and years and that you won’t lose (sorry gotta make sure) sooooo a mobile app!

    Mais ca va etre un peu dur I think i need to pay the 120$ yearly Apple subscription to launch an app to the Appstore hhhuuuu

Where you could view individual souvenirs, photos, pictures and visualise us throughout the days, weeks, months years now!

But I need to do some mobile development which I’ve never done. I also can’t give you the excuse of saying I’m always coding something; you’ll certainly want to know what it is.

We can start coding something together, it’ll be a nice project that can be added in our CV, and it’ll be great experience.

I’ll ask for the smallest things you like, and I’ll try to incorporate it, because at the end of the day having your own website is nice, but what about your own mobile app.

I do hope that 1- the inspiration will come to add more stuff as I build the app. 2- That I can actually build the app.
