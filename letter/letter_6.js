UGHHH what a terrible ass day.

I woke up at like 3 A.M for the push ups. And before I came back to sleep 1-2 hours before going to Boston, I had a phone call which tbh is never a Goodnews receiving one at this hour. And basically, one of my closest friends, Adam, was killed at night…

The official version and the one I told my parents is that he died of a car accident… rights because there are so many accidents at Salaberry at 3 A.M. At the time of writing, you this, I’m still debating on whether I should tell you. You looked so happy in your dress I didn’t want you to feel bad or unhappy.

And you know what’s crazy, he called me at 11P.M. and he said he wanted to hang out and “go see some people”. I ALMOST SAID YES. I said yes. I just had to cancel on him because we were going out early the next time to go to Boston.

Not only I lost a brother to me, but I was saved by some fucking cheesy ass luck AbOuT GoInG TO BosToN.

I hate the fact that for the past 2 weeks I was ignoring him because I didn’t want to see him on a weekly basement. You know what he said the last time I saw him face to face: “Wheyey ta moune Elle Est trop bien, je lack trop, tkt a la fin de lete je get une moune and well go double date.”


I feel horrible I swear to God. It’s like he died and I just renced.

And then I tried my hardest all day long to act normal. It started with me thinking you were mad this morning based on the texts you wrote at the beginning of the day. Then me being trapped for 7 FUCKING HOURS in the car where I couldn’t say shit to anybody. You were the only one free since the rests had no cell signal.

AND EVEN THEN, ITS NOT LIKE I COULD CALL ABOUT WHAT I WAS FEELING.

That’s why I spammed the heart emoji, I think. I thought that I should profiter au maximum of the things right now. Which is also why I keep spamming you about wtf you want me to buy I think. It’s like my copping mechanic. Where to get out of bad thoughts I imperatively need to make someone happy. And fortunately (or unfortunately I don’t really know how you see the situation) this person is you. When you saw me texting on snap but not sending you anything it was me writing the beginning to this… (I don’t even know what it is, It was supposed to be another entry of the journal you told me to make when I broke my back). But then I didn’t want to because I wanted you to enjoy the wedding.

I don’t know if I did a good job at that but hey at least you come back with extra bracelets, earrings, and a watch.


But I still can’t believe it. He died and I was supposed to die with him. I was only saved by some dumb luck. I lost someone who looked at me as his mentor. We would always do crazy shits together. He even used to say that I should invite him to my wedding (after I talked about you to him) … well I guess he won’t be able to do that anymore.

And now, I’m going to live with the fact that I won’t ever get to see him ever again and that I denied him of hist last moments with me.

MY FUCKING BROSKI, THE ONE I WAS PLANNING ON PRESENTING TO ONCE YOU CAME BACK. HES DEAD, HE DIED ALONE IN HIS CAR WHILE I WAS SLEEPING CONFORTABLY IN MY BED. 2 WEEKS AGO, HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WANTED US TO BOUND MORE LIKE WE WERE AT BDB AND IN HIGH SCHOOL.

I FEEL SO BAD, ITS MY FAULT AND THERES LITERALY NOTHING I CAN DO. ALL I CAN TRY IS TO MAKE AMENDS WITH MYSELF AND BE THERE FOR EVERYONE I LOVE.

AT LEAST I HOPE THAT’S THE MINIMUM. I was deadass serious when I said for the first time in a long time, I’ll try to be grateful for the smallest things, starting with being alive.


Anyways, I hope your wedding was great.
