    date: 'July 31, 2023', content: `(NGL this letter was meant to be a standalone and not part of the journal. I thought about changing it, so it fits the whole journal idea, but I like the idea of keeping it as is.)

I wanted to make this letter to tell you in writing what I don’t think I’ll be able to tell you in real life.

This is the “rant” II wanted you to come back to mtl to tell you: I genuinely hate how I’ve changed. Not that its bad, its just that I feel so weird/bad about myself when all I can think about all day long is you.

Your hairs (that always end in my mouth), your eyes (that I always get lost in), your neck that are just so elegant, them (hahaha)… But also, your personality, your aura, your presence. I realised that I really missed you during the last 3 weeks. It’s really like you said, “you’re my favorite person.”

I constantly want to talk, see, and stay with you. I want to treat you like a Queen, make you experience new things and being drowned in gifts. Believe me, I get way more enjoyment seeing you smiling after getting something from me than you do. I mainly work stupid hours because I want you to be cherished. I love seeing you happy, it brings me joy when you’re happy. Believe me, dunks are nothing compared to what I have in mind.

No this isn’t the horniness talking, ever since le spot at Mirabel (I told you I am always 2 steps ahead) where I disclose that I would gladly wait how long you want to go further, I wanted to tell you more… and here we are. Your one of the greatest things that happened to me, and I consider myself extremely lucky to have you and I pledge to make you the happiest woman on earth.

I know this isn’t the typical Algerian man behavior. I’m sorry if I often come as clingy, way too attached. I swear I’m trying to work on that. But am just scared that me “letting go” a little bit will make you think that I’m starting to get disinterested or worse, ill start believing so.

Which is why I may have come as a bit “engaging” while you were 7000km away, your absence + the thought that soon enough summer will be over made me feel nauseous. I wanted to see you because I missed you but then every time, I would see you or we would end a call, I would stare at my phone for hours. With the convo still open, at a crossroad as to why I should do.

 I was remained that even though we called for hours, you still weren’t with me. I am also scared that once school restarted, we would lose… whatever we have right now; whatever it is (can you tell I’m really going freestyle mode hahaha)

All in all, to say, that I really care for you, and I love you. Now I can’t really be here with you reacting to this letter nor do I know when you’re going to read this letter, but I hope that you understand the message and can accept it for what it is.

As I said when I gave it to you, you really can do whatever you want with this letter. You can talk about it… or you can ignore it forever. You can call me right after reading this saying I’m weird for writing these things in paper… or you can burn this card. The choice is yours BzzBzz and no matter what you decide to do, just know that I love you.
