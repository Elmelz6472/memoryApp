    I saw saif today which was great. We talked for hours since I haven’t really seen him or talked to him for the past month and a half. I won’t really go deep into it because well it was mostly guys talk so sex and sports basically hahaha.

Also, the more I think about it, the more the entries I’m making are becoming letters to you. It’s just so weird how subconsciously you can change over a relatively “short” amount of time (short in “” because believe me your time away hasn’t been short)


And then we met with Ouadi at the good old mcdo cure where I mostly had to help Ouadi with his situationship. And not to be all cheesy and shit but dam I’ve remembered all the things we did while in school. Before and after starting dating. Don’t worry I didn’t expose it out loud hahaha.

But seriously me remembering auditorium, you getting on top of me after the sushi, we kissing after the first time we got ice cream at la dipperie. You trying to see where I was in school by Soraya. Us doing boring ass things after school so we could still spend time with each other. The day you decided to confront me after the whole HB debacle, the famous? and UDEM Laval scenarios…

…

I also made the stupid ass mistakes of opening the shared album of the two of us and ooo boiii was that a mistake, it just made me miss you even more.

…

Also, I told you multiple times today but Jesus you are gorgeous with the wedding dress.

After that I mostly helped around the house because we’re going to Boston tomorrow. Can you imagine that… Going to vacations without any work (let’s not jinx tho).



Anyways that’s enough rumbling, sorry if I bored you again with the trip down memory lane

Love you!
