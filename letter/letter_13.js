I think I’ve found the best gift for our 1 year. It’s a masterplan hahaha. Basically, I want to play around memories and souvenirs. I got it from what you told me in the ramen restaurant where you took pictures. They can immortalize moments for ever so BITCH THAT’S WHAT IM GONNA DO. Basically, I want to use the daily vlogs, photos, videos, and everything I learned about you for the past year to show you how amazing the year has been.

I am however going to need a bit of time so brainstorm the idea, but I really think I’ve landed a goldmine.

Also you looked super cuteeeeee yesterday with the tupac shirt and the jordans.

In the meantime, off to go at udem to help bzzBzz with le TP de 2440.
