    Ayyy long time since I wrote some things, ngl I don’t really miss it but hey here I am. It’s probably going to be the last entry of the summer, so I wanted to congratulate myself (insert Kanye joke) for the great times I (we) had.

I don’t really know how the next session is going to turn out. But don’t worry I’ll always be here … ahem I kind of took math discrete for your hahaha). Aside that There’s INF2440 which will be sooo fun since its react and you’re a frontend girly, so you got thissss.


I’ll also bring some snacks for Lydia and Nadia since I haven’t seen them all summer long. I know I’m really not helping the whole personas of being son neveux ha-ha.

But I’m also really looking forward into taking walks and chill au bord de l’eau like we did when we used to start dating. I know we kind of did that during the summer but there’s something about doing that with backpacks that just makes sense.

Btw whats’up with the first day outfit lol, in rawis word: it aint that deep (purr you’ll look gorgeous im sure). Although it's so unfortunate that the jordans i got you dont fit you.

Alright where here's to a great year!
