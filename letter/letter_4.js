And then after that well go to Boston (wink wink) and will return to MTL… where you’ll return the day after yeayyy.

Enough of me, I got to admit that yellow dress you’re wearing while in Tunisia is top notch (imagine me doing a chef’s kiss). Also, your hair in a bun really looks good on you. Tbh almost everything looks good on you. Especially BRB (WOAWWW)


I never thought I would say this but THANK GOD you’re with your dad. Like the internet connection is way better than when you were in Algeria.


Dam I also wonder if you’ll have the N-Word pass. We’ll be the first n-word pass holder couple that aren’t black. Btw did you know I have it.


Also don’t toot your own horn but I’m really starting to get a liking to writing. Even now we both know that languages aren’t really my strong suits.

You also said that you’re having an insolation… whatever the fuck this is. Stay hydrated and yes, I’m sending positive energy you don’t have to worry about that.

You know I keep saying positive energy, but I don’t really what that mean. Just know that I think about you, and YOU NEED TO DRINK WATER.

Anyway, that’s enough rumbling, please try not to drown at the beach.
