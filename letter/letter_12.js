    You know, I might jinx it, but the past 2 months HAVE BEEN AMAZING. I don’t really know how to describe but it’s like were in sync (sync is such a fun word). Maybe the step we passed on 6th month helped… (who am I kidding it definitely did).

But like now were in sync its only getting better and better and better. Sometimes it’s me on you and sometimes in you on me (usually at your house tho cause miskin cardi in the car). Especially when its randomly and you just tell me to go park over there (SIGN ME UP MAMA BEAR). I know we still need to keep in check some limits to not get crazier, but I can only imagine how great it’ll be by next year or during the winter/summer vacations ;)

Plus, the whole massage with the vouzin was really fun we definitely need to book more days 4 you. And sometimes, even if nothing happens, i get spicy pictures, ughhhhh its awesome! And sometimes we just talk about our fantasies and what we dream and think about and I feel like I'm making some real progress and its just so exciting to think of the possibilities. I finally feel like we went past the deadlock and can both feel new feelings together at the same time. Plus, it's probably just hormones but youre overly pretty like ya vrm pas

But aside the whole sexual element, I just love chilling me bringing/cooking food and chilling with you (although if you could do what you did in the summer it’ll be amazingier). I also realised its some sort of vicious circle where if I do something you do something which makes me want to do something and so on and I LOVE ITTT. Like you started talking about making me watch, I made a personal website, you give me surprises, I give you a 3 star breakfast with persona masseur hhhh its like were so in sync its crazy.

Like Succession is such an amazing show we watch it, we bitch about Shiv and Tom we support Gerri, then the day after we study for school (except Stats fuck Stats) aahhhhh I love ittt.

I mean yea we were a bit cold with the intras but tbh it's really hard talking and engaging with you when your sick and on your period, but I feel it only made the relationship better.

I’m definitely jixing that am I

Anyways big bisou bzzbzz`, note:"-A very in happy bozo"
